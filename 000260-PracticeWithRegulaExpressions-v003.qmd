# <yrChapterNumber></yrChapterNumber> Practice with Regular Expressions

Please refer to the following websites for some practice with creating Regular
Expressions (regex). 
Solutions are available online if you get stuck.

- The following website has a tutorial and practice problems as you
  work through the tutorial: <https://regexone.com/>   ( also see:
  <https://umar-yusuf.blogspot.com/2021/03/regexonecom-alternative-solution.html> )

- The following is another website with a short tutorial and practice problems:
  <http://regextutorials.com/>

- The following website encourages you to practice regex concepts through 
  puzzles that are very similar to typical "crossword" puzzles. Make sure 
  to read "how to play". There is a website and an app for your phone. 
  They are both good (the phone app is much easier for using on a phone 
  than the website): <https://regexcrossword.com/>
