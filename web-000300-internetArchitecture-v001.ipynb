        "\n",
        "Each domain name, which represents a computer on the Internet,\n",
        "(e.g. www.mygreatwebsite.com) has a corresponding IP address. \n",
        "You can think of \n",
        "the domain name and IP address for a computer on the Internet\n",
        "as being analogous to a person's name and the person's phone\n",
        "number.\n",
        "In order for one computer on the Internet to contact another computer,\n",
        "the first computer must know the IP address of the computer it wants to\n",

        "know the IP address for the computer running the website. Your browser\n",
        "must \"look up\" the IP address. \n",
        "If you don't know a person's phone number but you know their\n",
        "name you can \"look up\" their phone number. In the mid 1900s it was common\n",
        "for someone to \"call an operator\" to get someone's phone number.\n",
        "This is similar to what happens with a browser when contacting \n",
        "a website for the first time. The browser needs to find out the \n",
        "IP address for the website. To find the IP address, the browser \n",
        "contacts another computer, known as a Domain Name Server (AKA, DNS server).\n",
        "The browser asks the DNS server to provide the IP address for the\n",
        "website's domain name\n",
        "(e.g. www.mygreatwebsite.com). This IP address (e.g. 89.123.92.5) is then\n",
        "sent back to the browser. This communication between the browser and the \n",
        "DNS server is labeled in the diagram as steps (1) and (2). This all\n",
        "happens \"behind the scenes\" and you as a typical computer user is \n",
        "totally unaware that all of this is happening.\n",
        "\n",
        "The browser then uses the IP address to \n",
        "contact the web-server for the website. This is shown in the diagram\n",

        "of the computer that it is trying to contact. If so, how does your computer\n",
        "know the IP address of the DNS server computer? The answer is simple.\n",
        "Your computer is configured with that information. This all happens\n",
        "when your computer is setup with Internet service. \n",
        "\n",
        "Every Internet Service Provider has DNS servers that their users computers\n",
        "are configured to contact. Your computer has been configured to contact\n",
        "the DNS server for your Internet Service Provider. The following shows \n",
        "how to see your DNS server settings on Windows and Mac. Note that \n",
        "these instructions can become outdated with newer releases of Windows\n",

        "a specific IP address corresponds to a specific computer. When asked for the\n",
        "IP address of a domain name, the DNS server might respond with different IP \n",
        "addresses to different requests for the same domain name.\n",
        "In this way google, amazon and other large \n",
        "websites can spread the work (i.e. the load) of supporting the web requests\n",
