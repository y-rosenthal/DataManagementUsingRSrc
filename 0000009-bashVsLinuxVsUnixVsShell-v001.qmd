# <yrChapterNumber>5. </yrChapterNumber> Terminology: Bash vs Linux vs Unix vs Shell

When
## \"Bash commands\" or \"Linux commands\" ? 

Technically, many of the commands that you run in Bash are actually
\"Linux\" commands (or Unix commands). Therefore when searching online
for information, it is often more appropriate to use the words \"Linux
command\" in your search instead of \"Bash command\". As we said above,
the Bash shell, is only one of many CLIs that are available on Linux.
However, the majority of commands we will learn are able to be used with
ANY Linux CLI and not just Bash.

In addition to being able to use Bash on Apple Mac, you can also access
many of the vast majority of these \"Linux\" commands on Mac. (Remember
that Linux and Mac are both derived from the Unix operating system).
Similarly, when you install a Bash environment on Windows, it will
include many of these \"Linux\" programs too.
