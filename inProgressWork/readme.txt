This folder contains files that I am working on. If they were copied from an earlier
semester's work, then I might create a folder to indicate that.
These files should be checked into git but would not be part of the actual book.
Once I finish with my "inProgressWork" and a file is "ready for the actual book"
I plan to move that file into the parent directory that contains all the other 
.qmd files.
