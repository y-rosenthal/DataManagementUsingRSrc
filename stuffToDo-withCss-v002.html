      /* The code that appears in the HTML style element is actually a 
         different language (i.e. not HTML). This language is known as
         Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS is used
         to describe formatting (e.g. colors, fonts, placement, etc) 
         of different items that appear in the webpage. 
         As with HTML, there are many, many details to CSS. We will be covering
         very few of them. 
         
         In CSS comments appear between slash* and *slash (where slash is /).
         This is a CSS comment.
         
         Some people are surprised that a single .html file could 
         contain more than one language. This is similar to an English
         file that contains some quotes in Hebrew, Chinese, or any 
         other language. 

         CSS consists of rules that describe which parts of the HTML document
         should be "styled" in a specific ways. Each rule is in the form
            selectors { property:value; anotherProperty:value; etc ... }
            
         The selectors define which parts of the HTML are affected by the 
         rule. Each property:value describes a particular styling that should
         be applied. See the examples below.
      */

         
      /* SOME SAMPLE CSS RULES */
      
      /* all li tags should be blue */
      li { color: blue;}                  
      
      /* li tags that are inside ul tags should have a yellow background */
      ul li { background-color: yellow; }  
      
      /* both h1 and h2 tags should be green */
      h1, h2 { color: green; }   
      
      /* Text in h2 tags should be centered */
      h2 { text-align: center; } 
      
      /* strong tags should be red and italicized */
      strong { color: red ; font-style: italic;}


      /* The .class and #id CSS selectors are used to apply CSS rules
         to two very specify situations.
         
         #something   is used to apply the rule to any HTML element that has
         an attribute of id="something". For example the CSS rule
         
             #copyright { font-size: 75%; }
         
         would be applied to the HTML
         <p id="copyright"> &copy; 2023 </p>
         
         
         .something   is used to apply the rule to any HTML element that has
         an attribute of class="something" or class="abc def something etc".
         For example the CSS rule 
             .important { font-size: 200%; }
         would be applied to any of the following:
         
           <p class="important"> ...</p>
           <li class="work important finance"> ... </li>
           etc.
           
           The difference between the id attribute and the class attribute
           is that an id should only appear once in an entire html page.
           id is used for example for copyright notices, navigation sections
           etc.
           
           The same class can appear multiple times on a page.
           
           Both the id and the class attributes may appear in ANY html tag.
      */
      
      
      /* <div>...</div>    and    <span>...</span>
      
         The <div>...</div> and <span>...</span> HTML elements are used
         to apply CSS to portions of a document that don't otherwise
         contain other HTML tags. To understand these HTML elements you 
         need to understand that there are two general types of HTML tags:
         
         * "block HTML elements" (e.g. h1, h2, ul, ol, table, etc)
           create the general structure of the HTML. 
           When these tags are displayed (i.e. "rendered") in the browser, by
           default there the next content appears on a new line.
         
         * "inline HTML elements" (e.g. strong, em, a, img, etc) do specific
           things, but don't layout the general structure of the page. Therefore
           by default there is no automatic newline after these elements. 
         
             <span class="someClass"> ... </span>
         
           is used to surround other "inline" HTML tags.

      /* CSS RULES FOR #id and .class SELECTORS */
      
      /* tags that have an attribute    class="person"   
         should have its font twice as large as normal */
      .person { border: 3px dashed black; }
      
      /*.weekend { font-family: "Comic Sans MS", "Comic Sans", cursive; }*/
      /* Use a "fun" cursive font for the weekends */
      .weekend { font-family: cursive; }
      
      .important { font-size: 200%; }
      
      /* tags that have an attribute    id="navigationLinks"   
         should have a blue border with 10px of padding around it and 
         the text should be centered */
      #navigationLinks { border: 10px solid blue; padding:10px; text-align: center;}
      
      /* make the one element on the page whose start tag contains the 
         attribute, id="copyright", 75% of it's normal text font size */
      #copyright { font-size: 75%; }
