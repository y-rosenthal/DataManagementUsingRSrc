# <yrChapterNumber>27. </yrChapterNumber> Get the data - "books database" and other tables

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

# dataframes should display in the following width without "wrapping"
options(width = 999)
```

As we learn about databases and SQL we will need to refer to various 
collections of data (i.e. "tables" of data in SQL terminology). 
See below for info on how to download and install
the various collections of data into R.


```{r}
#| include: FALSE

require(sqldf)
file.copy(from="data/grades.csv", to=".")
file.copy(from="data/sqlbolt_tables-v007.RData", to=".")
```

## Prepare to import the data

In order to read the data into R and to access the data using SQL, we will
need to load the R packages "readr" and "sqldf". We do so with
the following commands:

```{r}
#| output: false
#| warning: false

if(!require(readr)){install.packages("readr");require(readr);}
if(!require(sqldf)){install.packages("sqldf");require(sqldf);}
```


## import the data: grades

Download the CSV file: [grades.csv](grades.csv) 

This a .csv file that contains information
about students and their grades.
You can read the contents of the file into R 
with the read.csv function as shown below.

```{r}
grades = read.csv("grades.csv")
```
  
Once you've done so, you can display the data:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Click here - grades table
```{r}
sqldf("select * from grades")
```
:::

## import the data: customers, orders, movies, north_american_cities, etc

Download the RData file: [sqlbolt_tables-v007.RData](sqlbolt_tables-v007.RData)

A .RData file contains a copy of R's environment variables. You can 
save you environment variables to an RData file with the `save()` function.
(see ?save). Once you have an RData file, you can load those variables
into your R environment with the `load()` function (see ?load).

This RData file 
contains the following different dataframe variables. When using the 
sqldf() function, each dataframe 
variable can used as though it were a Relational Database table.

- customers
- orders
- movies
- north_american_cities
- as well as some others (boxOffice, buildings, employees)

Use the load function as shown below to load the data into R.

```{r}
load("sqlbolt_tables-v007.RData")
```

Below are the contents of these tables:

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Click here - grades table
```{r}
sqldf("select * from grades")
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Click here - movies table
```{r}
sqldf("select * from movies")
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Click here - orders table
```{r}
sqldf("select * from orders")
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Click here - customers table
```{r}
sqldf("select * from customers")
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Click here - north_american_cities table
```{r}
sqldf("select * from north_american_cities")
```
