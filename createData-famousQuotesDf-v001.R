# We will use the "tribble" function that is part of the "tibble" package
# to create the data. That makes the code much easier to read then the 
# way you would normally create a dataframe (or tibble) in R.
#
# We will convert the data to a regular data.frame below so that you 
# don't need to understand tibbles to use this code.
