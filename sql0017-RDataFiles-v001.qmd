# <yrChapterNumber></yrChapterNumber> .RData files - save.image() and load functions

The save.image function creates a file that contains the variables from your R 
environment. The created files typically have an .RData extension.
You can then reload those variables with R's load function.

See these help pages for more info.

`?save.image`
`?load`

The dataframes for the books database have been saved in the file

    booksDatabase-v004.RData

You can load those dataframes into your environment with the following
command (the command assumes that the file is in a subfolder
named "data" that is in the working directory).

```{r}
