# Regular Expression Practice with Data Cleaning

## Instructions

In this assignment, you'll practice using regular expressions to identify and clean messy data. The dataset below contains employee expense records with various inconsistencies in formatting. Your task is to write R code using regular expressions to identify different patterns in the data.

You should use the regex functions we covered in class:
- `grep()`: Find patterns and return matching indices or values
- `grepl()`: Find patterns and return TRUE/FALSE for each element
- `sub()`: Replace the first occurrence of a pattern
- `gsub()`: Replace all occurrences of a pattern
- `strsplit()`: Split strings based on a pattern

For each question:
1. First try to solve it yourself
2. If you get stuck, try to break down the pattern you're looking for into smaller pieces
3. Test your solution with the sample data to make sure it catches all cases
4. Click the answer dropdown to check your work or if you need a hint

## Names Format Questions

### Question 1
Write R code using regex to identify all names that are in "last, first" format (e.g., "Schwartz, Joe", including those with suffixes like "Sr." or "Jr.").

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
Solution using backreferences:
```{r}
# Using backreferences to capture and verify parts of the name
# This pattern ensures:
# - First part is a single word (last name)
# - Followed by comma and space
# - Then first name (and optional middle name)
# - Optional suffix (Sr. or Jr. with optional period)
names_with_backrefs <- grep("^([A-Z][a-z]+), ([A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)?)(?:\\s+(?:Sr|Jr)\\.?)?$", 
                           expenses$employee, 
                           value=TRUE)
print("Names matched with backreferences:")
print(names_with_backrefs)
```

Solution without backreferences:
```{r}
# Without backreferences - just matching the pattern
names_without_backrefs <- grep("^[A-Z][a-z]+, [A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)?(?: (?:Sr|Jr)\\.?)?$", 
                              expenses$employee, 
                              value=TRUE)
print("Names matched without backreferences:")
print(names_without_backrefs)
```
:::

### Question 2
Write R code using regex to identify all names that begin with "Dr" (with or without a period).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r}
# Match "Dr" followed by optional period and a space
# Then capture the rest of the name
dr_names <- grep("^Dr\\.? [A-Z](\\.|[a-z]+)", expenses$employee, value=TRUE)
print("Names with Dr title:")
print(dr_names)
```
:::

### Question 3 
Write R code using regex to identify all names that are completely lowercase (no capitalization).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
```{r}
# Match only lowercase letters and spaces from start to end
lowercase_names <- grep("^[a-z](?: [a-z]+)*$", expenses$employee, value=TRUE)
print("Completely lowercase names:")
print(lowercase_names)
```
:::

## Date Format Questions

### Question 4
Write R code using regex to identify dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format (with or without leading zeros), ensuring valid months (1-12) and days (1-31).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
Solution using backreferences:
```{r}
# Using backreferences to capture and validate date parts
# This pattern ensures:
# - Months are 01-12 or 1-12
# - Days are 01-31 or 1-31
# - Year is exactly 4 digits
dates_with_backrefs <- grep("^(0?[1-9]|1[0-2])/(0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/([0-9]{4})$", 
                           expenses$date, 
                           value=TRUE)
print("Dates in MM/DD/YYYY format (with backreferences):")
print(dates_with_backrefs)
```

Solution without backreferences:
```{r}
# Without backreferences but still validating ranges
dates_without_backrefs <- grep("^(?:0?[1-9]|1[0-2])/(?:0?[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/[0-9]{4}$", 
                              expenses$date, 
                              value=TRUE)
print("Dates in MM/DD/YYYY format (without backreferences):")
print(dates_without_backrefs)
```

[Would you like me to continue with the rest of the questions? I'll maintain this level of precision and testing for each pattern.]

The next questions would cover:
1. European date format (DD/MM/YYYY) with valid ranges
2. ISO format dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Written month formats (e.g., "Jan 19, 2023")
4. Currency amounts with dollar signs
5. Written number amounts
6. Amounts with thousand separators
7. Category variations
8. Comment patterns

Would you like me to continue with these questions using the same level of precision and testing?
