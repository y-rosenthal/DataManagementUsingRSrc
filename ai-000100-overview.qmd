# <yrChapterNumber></yrChapterNumber> AI in Everyday Use

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in 
recent years, with Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. chatgpt) and generative AI leading the way in transforming how we interact with data and technology. Below, we explore some key areas where AI is making an impact. Many or most of these tools can be used for free (sometimes
with limited features). Most tools also have a "paid" plan which allows for
additional features, for quicker responses, etc.

AI continues to rapidly evolve, with advancements in personalization, 
automation, and ethical considerations. As AI integrates further into 
everyday life, it will enhance how we work with data, make decisions, 
and create content.

Note that the content on this page itself was generated by chatgpt.com 
(in Feb 2025) and
edited by me. I did not confirm that all of the links work but if they don't
I recommend searching online for the current links.

## General purpose LLM Chat Websites

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI-powered tools capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Here are some well-known platforms where users can interact with these models. 
These are all roughly similar. Their features keep evolving. For example
as of this writing ChatGPT could generate picture while Claude.ai could not.
Exactly what is possible with each model might also depend on whether you are 
using a free version or are paying a fee.

- **ChatGPT** ([chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)) 

  This is a good overview of what is possible with chatgpt.com 
  as of Feb 2025. I recommend that you watch (perhaps on double speed) even
  if you are already familiar with chatGPT.com.
